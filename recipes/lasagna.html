    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted
        cheese. Traditionally, it features ground meat, such as beef or pork, seasoned with herbs and spices, though
        vegetarian versions are also popular, using a variety of vegetables or tofu. The dish is baked in the oven until
        bubbling and golden, creating a delicious, comforting meal that's perfect for family gatherings or special
        occasions.</p>

    <p>The key to a perfect lasagna lies in the balance of flavors and the layering technique. A slow-cooked tomato
        sauce, combined with fresh pasta sheets, and a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses create a
        harmonious dish that’s both hearty and satisfying. Whether you're using a meat sauce or a vegetarian filling,
        lasagna is sure to please a crowd!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (24 oz) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until
            softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the marinara sauce and season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow
            the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, chopped basil, and parsley. Mix until smooth and
            well-blended.</li>
        <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of ricotta mixture, a sprinkle of
            mozzarella, and a bit of Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of mozzarella and
            Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15
            minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow it to set.</li>
