    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Noodles are a versatile and beloved dish enjoyed across the globe. Made from unleavened dough, noodles can be boiled, fried, or steamed, depending on the dish. Whether served in a savory broth, tossed with stir-fried vegetables, or mixed with sauces, noodles can be adapted to a wide range of cuisines, from Chinese and Italian to Thai and Japanese.</p>

    <p>The key to perfect noodles lies in their texture—soft, chewy, and well-cooked. Paired with a flavorful sauce, meat, or vegetables, noodles make for a hearty meal that's quick to prepare and easy to customize. From simple pasta dishes to elaborate noodle stir-fries, noodles are a satisfying meal option for any time of day.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>8 oz noodles (egg noodles, ramen, or your preferred type)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>

        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Add the sliced onion and garlic to the skillet and sauté for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</li>

        <li>Add the cooked noodles to the skillet and toss to combine with the vegetables.</li>
