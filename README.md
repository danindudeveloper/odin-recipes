## Introduction

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum and focuses on applying and demonstrating fundamental **HTML** skills. The goal is to create a simple webpage that showcases various HTML elements and best practices, helping solidify my understanding of the language.

Upon completion, I will have demonstrated proficiency in:

- Implementing basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and tables.
